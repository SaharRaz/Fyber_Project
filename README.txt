hey,
I was able to do most of the exercise except for the jenkins part(stage 2: section 3 and 4 the jenkins part).
I did not manage to write the README file because I tried to explore this part in depth.
The Python part was the easier part in my opinion.
Thanks for the opportunity to learn new things and for the challenge I will continue until I succeed.
